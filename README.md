# **Fertility-Diagnosis-Dataset-Using-Machine-Learning**
Completed this project as part of my Data Science and Machine Learning Internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP). Key highlights:

* Studied and Analyzed the Fertility Diagnosis dataset to applying ML models and present my insights.
* Performed various Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data and compare the variables.
* Experimented with different Machine Learning algorithms, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Bagging, Boosting,SVM and KNN.
* Compared the results to recommend the best Machine Learning model.
